The objective of this test is to measure the knowledge of the frontend developer, for this 6 fundamental aspects will be qualified that will allow us to know first-hand the seniority level of each participant, each of the aspects to be evaluated are present in the exam and must be answered at the least once per item, remember that it is more important to cover each aspect than to repeat the same thing several times.

You have a total of two hours to develop the exam from the moment you are authorized to start it. It is important to remember that no questions will be answered about the exam, a fundamental part of what is evaluated is your ability to interpret and solve problems, however if you have problems with the repository or to start the project, you will be gladly assisted.

# It is very important to remember that:

**Remember that once the time limit has expired, the exam will not be valid, for example if it is determined that the two hours expire at 6:25 pm and you upload your exam at 6:26 pm it will be considered no valid.**
